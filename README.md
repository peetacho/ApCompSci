Credit to James Young: Used a bit of James' codes from module 4-14. 

The different modules are seperated. Within each module, there are lesson examples and another folder with the assignment.

Notes:
- Pls ignore ds store files, gitignore, and Icon.
- For modules 14,15,and 16, there is a Computer science lab picture assignment. This assignment has a crap ton of html and
whatnot included in the package. I singled out the important .java files for module 15 and 16. Module 14 will have the crap
ton of html crap.
